# Java-Puzzle-4-x-4-Puzzle-Solver

This project is a Java implementation of a sliding puzzle solver using the A* search algorithm. The program allows the user to input a 4x4 puzzle board and a sequence of moves, and it will solve the puzzle if possible.

Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the Java file: javac Puzzle.java
3. Run the program
4. Enter the puzzle board in order from left to right and top to bottom, providing integers only. Puzzle will be in 4 x 4 grid.
5. Input the moveset (e.g., "UDLR") to manipulate the puzzle.
6. The program will display the puzzle state after each move and indicate success or failure.
